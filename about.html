    <h2>About Bedrock Boulders</h2>
    
    <div class="about-section">
      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>Founded in 2015 by Corey Chao, <strong>Bedrock Boulders</strong> was created to make high-quality, custom stonework accessible to everyone. Based in Houston, Texas, we specialize in crafting custom headstones, ranch signs, and commercial signage using durable, weather-resistant engineered stone. Our vision was born from a desire to offer affordable alternatives to traditional granite, ensuring families, ranchers, and businesses can honor their legacies without excessive costs or delays.</p>
      <p>Corey, a Houston native with over a decade of experience in design and stone craftsmanship, saw an opportunity to simplify the process while maintaining exceptional quality. Today, Bedrock Boulders is a trusted name in the Greater Houston area, known for our commitment to affordability, speed, and personalized service.</p>

      <h3>Why Engineered Stone?</h3>
      <p>Our engineered stone sets us apart. It’s not only cost-effective—allowing us to offer headstones starting at <strong>$899</strong>—but also highly durable, designed to withstand Houston’s extreme weather, from scorching summers to heavy storms. Unlike traditional materials, our stone resists cracking, fading, and erosion, ensuring your memorial or sign remains pristine for generations.</p>
      <p>We combine cutting-edge design software with hands-on craftsmanship in our Houston workshop. From your initial concept to the final installation, most projects are completed in <strong>6–8 weeks</strong>, making us one of the fastest in the industry without sacrificing attention to detail.</p>
